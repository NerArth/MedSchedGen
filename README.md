# MedSchedGen
Accepts user input to generate a medication schedule. The generated table page can be printed for the purpose of memorialising what medication to take, what doses, and at what time it was actually taken. Side-by-side use of a working-memory journal or activity journal are highly recommended.

The HTML page, the script it uses, and the CSS styling, are all self-contained within the HTML file. As such, the webpage can be downloaded/saved to your local machine.
