# MedSchedGen
A stable version of the tool can be used in your browser, here: https://nerarth.github.io/MedSchedGen/

It may not be as up-to-date as the `.html` you see in the `/main/` branch.

## Overview
Accepts user input to generate a medication schedule. The generated table page can be printed for the purpose of memorialising what medication to take, what doses, and at what time it was actually taken. Side-by-side use of a working-memory journal or activity journal are highly recommended.

The HTML page, the script it uses, and the CSS styling, are all self-contained within the HTML file. As such, the webpage can be downloaded/saved to your local machine and used from there.

## Wishlist/To-do
(no specific order)
- Better default formatting/styling
- More flexibility with medication/dosing
- Clearer structure and examples on how to use the tool
- Add options for dose/medication colour-coding, up to user preference
- Add an option to pick which day of the week the schedule starts on (*Sunday*, *Monday*, etc.)
- Add an option for padding out days so it makes a square table
- Make it easier to download the tool for offline use
- Add version information
- Fix the way GitHub pages is working

## Notes
The wishlist above is just that, a list of wishes. However, I really would like to add support for colour-coding per medication/dose, as this is something that is very useful for double-checking the right medication is being taken.

This tool was created for my personal use as part of keeping track of medication changes while doing titration for ADHD medication, so this is the designed real-world use for the tool.
