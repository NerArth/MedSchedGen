# MedSchedGen
Accepts user input to generate a medication schedule. The generated table page can be printed for the purpose of memorialising what medication to take, what doses, and at what time it was actually taken. Side-by-side use of a working-memory journal or activity journal are highly recommended.

The HTML page, the script it uses, and the CSS styling, are all self-contained within the HTML file. As such, the webpage can be downloaded/saved to your local machine.

This tool was created for personal use as part of keeping track of medication changes while doing titration for ADHD medication, so this is the designed real-world use for the tool.
